        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p>My name is Connor Leuteritz. I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I am a student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/"> The University of Rhode Island</a>.
            In my free time here, I am part of a fraternity, as well as a starting defensemen for the mens <a target="_blank" href="https://mcla.us/team/rhode_island/2023/schedule.html"> URI Lacrosse team </a>
                  . I am currently majoring in marketing and attempting to minor in web programming.<br><br>
            In my spare time I root for all Boston sports. My favorite team to watch is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patriots.com/"> New England Patriots </a>. 
                  With that being said the sport I watch the least is Baseball. I really don't watch too frequently unless its playoff season for the team.
            This is no hate towards any of the teams, I just struggle to find the time for 80 games in a season to sit down and watch. Due to being in both business, and lacrosse
            I always make sure to pay attention to the <a target="_blank" href="https://premierlacrosseleague.com/"> PLL </a> due to the interesting nature of how the league operates.</p>
