        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p>My name is Connor Leuteritz. I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I am a student at <a target="_blank" href="www.uri.edu"> The University of Rhode Island</a>.
            In my free time here, I am part of a fraternity, as well as a starting defensemen for the mens URI Lacrosse team. I am currently majoring in marketing
            and attempting to minor in web programming.<br><br>
            In my spare time I root for all Boston sports. My favorite team to watch is the New England Patriots. 
                  With that being said the sport I watch the least is Baseball. I really don't watch too frequently unless its playoff season for the team.
            This is no hate towards any of the teams, I just struggle to find the time for 80 games in a season to sit down and watch. Due to being in both business, and lacrosse
            I always make sure to pay attention to the PLL due to the interesting nature of how the league opperates.</p>
